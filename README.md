This project analyzes and designs a hydraulically actuated mechanical system controlled by a servo valve and a hydraulic cylinder. The objective was to develop a state-space model, simulate system motion under a predefined reference trajectory, design a PDI (PID) controller, and finally perform hydraulic system sizing and component selectio
